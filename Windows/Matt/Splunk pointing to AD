#1.) Google "Splunk Universal Forwarder". The first result should bring you to the prompter page. 

#2.) If your version is older there should be below the new options there is an older options link. There will be any other 
versions you need. 

#3.) Once downloaded it will prompt you to enter a Deployment Server. This can be the AD or whatever is running Splunk, either 
way enter the IP or host name. 

#4.) Next it will ask what the Index Server is, this can be the same as the deployment. It's up to you and your current setup but 
as said before enter the IP or hostname and continue. 

#5.) After this it will do a couple things but should be completely done. You can check the server running splunk to verfify it 
is monitoring your logs. Now you're all done (:
